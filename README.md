## File Description
1_ : My first attempt to analyze the COVID-19 dataset back in Feb. It was a descriptive analysis. I wanted to understand what was the trend, especially in China. It demonstrated that I could clean data and utilize different graphs to represent the data. 

2_ : My second attempt to analyze the COVID-19 dataset. I used a simple line-fitting model to predict the potential growth. I also did more descriptive analysis but from the angle of showing, how different timing of policy intervention made the rate of increase differently.
