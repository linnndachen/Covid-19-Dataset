## 1. Project Motivation
This folder is for recuritment purpose. It has my most updated resume and different projects that can demonstrate my skills. However, because I am still continuously learning every day, this folder does not mean it is everything that I know. Please reach out to me so that we can know each other better if you think I might have the potential :)

## 2. File Description
1_ : My first attempt to analyze the COVID-19 dataset back in Feb. It was a descriptive analysis. I wanted to understand what was the trend, especially in China. It demonstrated that I could clean data and utilize different graphs to represent the data. 

2_ : My second attempt to analyze the COVID-19 dataset. I used a simple line-fitting model to predict the potential growth. I also did more descriptive analysis but from the angle of showing, how different timing of policy intervention made the rate of increase differently. 

3_ : Telecom company ustomer churn analysis by using a Kaggle public dataset. I used different tree models to predict and I picked a model that addresses minimize the business cost the most. 

Because this is an imbalanced dataset, I did a seperate project. In that project, I used all the different technqiues to handle an imbalanced dataset and compared each tree ML model's performance by using different techniques. That project can be found on my Kaggle. To understand why each ML model performed differently when using different techniques to handle imbalanced dataset, I also wrote a blog on it.
